# beetDeck

![logo](logo.svg)

A web interface for managing a [beets](https://beets.io/) music library. beetDeck does not handle file importing — it enhances an existing library with identification (MusicBrainz autotag), genres (Last.fm), cover art, lyrics, and tag browsing.

Works well alongside tools like Lidarr that manage the file library, while beets serves as an additional tagging layer on top.

## Features

- **Library browser** — collapsible artist list with album thumbnails, year, and tagged status
- **Artist page** — dedicated page with album grid for a single artist
- **Album detail** — cover art with lightbox, metadata, file path, full track listing
- **Search** — full-text search across artists, albums, and tracks (full Unicode support)
- **Filter by status** — filter albums by tagged / untagged on library and artist pages
- **Identification** — MusicBrainz autotag with candidate selection, diff preview, confirm & write
- **Genre tagging** — Last.fm genre lookup with old/new preview and confirm
- **Cover art** — fetch from multiple sources (filesystem, Cover Art Archive, iTunes, Amazon), preview, confirm; manual upload supported. High-res file + embedded thumbnail
- **Lyrics** — per-track and bulk album lyrics via lrclib (synced and plain text). Inline viewer/editor, online search with diff preview, external `.lrc` file embed
- **Rescan** — quick (incremental) or full library rescan to add new files and remove stale entries
- **Light/dark theme** — auto-detects system preference with manual toggle, persisted in localStorage

## Quick start

### 1. Prepare beets config

Create a directory for beets configuration and copy the example config:

```bash
mkdir -p ./beetdeck-config
cp config.yaml ./beetdeck-config/config.yaml
```

See [`config.yaml`](config.yaml) for an example beets configuration.

### 2. Run with docker compose

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  beetdeck:
    image: semsemyonoff/beetdeck
    container_name: beetdeck
    user: "1000:1000"  # match your music library file ownership
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/London
      - BEETSDIR=/config/beets
      - BEETS_LIBRARY_DB=/data/beets/library.db
      - BEETS_IMPORT_DIR=/music
    volumes:
      - ./beetdeck-config:/config/beets:ro   # beets config (read-only)
      - ./beetdeck-data:/data/beets           # database & state (writable)
      - /path/to/your/music:/music            # music library (writable)
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

### 4. Initial library scan

Click **Rescan Library** → **Full Scan** in the UI to populate the beets database from your music directory. After the initial scan, use **Quick Scan** for incremental updates.

## Configuration

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TZ` | `UTC` | Container timezone |
| `BEETSDIR` | `/config/beets` | beets configuration directory |
| `BEETS_LIBRARY_DB` | `/data/beets/library.db` | Path to beets SQLite database |
| `BEETS_IMPORT_DIR` | `/music` | Music library root for rescan |

### Volumes

| Container path | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `/config/beets` | beets configuration — **read-only** |
| `/data/beets` | Database (`library.db`) and state (`state.pickle`) — **must be writable** |
| `/music` | Music library — **must be writable** for tag writing, cover embedding, lyrics |

### Running as non-root

The container runs as whatever `user:` is set in compose. Make sure the UID/GID has:
- **Read** access to the beets config volume (`/config/beets`)
- **Read/write** access to the data volume (`/data/beets`)
- **Read/write** access to the music library volume (for writing tags, covers, lyrics)

### beets plugins

The following beets plugins are used and should be listed in `config.yaml`:

| Plugin | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `musicbrainz` | Album identification / autotag |
| `fetchart` | Cover art fetching from online sources |
| `embedart` | Embedding cover art into audio files |
| `lastgenre` | Genre tagging via Last.fm |
| `lyrics` | Lyrics fetching (lrclib) |
| `info` | Reading raw file tags |

All plugins have `auto: no` — beetDeck triggers them on demand through the UI.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Flask + gunicorn (1 worker, 4 threads). Single worker is required because in-memory state (identification tasks, cover previews) must be shared across requests.
- **Frontend**: vanilla JavaScript SPA with hash-based routing (`#` = library, `#artist/<name>` = artist page, `#album/<id>` = album page). No build tools or dependencies.
- **beets integration**: uses the beets Python API directly (not the CLI) for identification, genre lookup, cover art, and lyrics. The CLI is only used for `beet import` (rescan) and `beet update` (prune stale entries).
